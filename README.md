Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of ANOVA-BART, a Bayesian nonparametric model for functional ANOVA decomposition based on regression trees.
The method achieves:

  1. Near-minimax optimal posterior concentration rates
  
  2. Component-wise convergence guarantees unavailable for standard BART
  
  3. Flexible Bayesian modeling of main and interaction effects
